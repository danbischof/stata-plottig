New Figure Schemes for Stata: plotplain & plottig

While stata's computational capabilities have intensively increased over the last decade, the quality of its default figure schemes is still a matter of debate amongst users. Clearly some of the arguments speaking against stata figures are subject to individual taste, but others are not, such as for instance: horizontal labelling, unnecessary background tinting, missing gridlines, oversized markers. The two schemes introduced here attempt to solve the major shortcomings of stata's default figure schemes. 
Furthermore, the schemes come with 21 new colors, of which seven colors are distinguishable for people suffering from color blindness.
